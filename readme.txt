= I installed and activated the plugin, but it doesn't work =

To use the plugin, you need to add the [`body_class()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/body_class/) function to your theme.

This function should go inside the `body` tag, which is usually located in the `header.php` file in your theme's directory.
